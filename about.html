Background:
<div>
My passion for working with others propelled me into the Army ROTC program at <a style="color: #00a4a7;" href="http://www.pitt.edu/">The University of Pittsburgh</a>, where I completed my Computer Engineering Degree with highlights in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, the US Patent and Trademark Office, and a cooperative venture with the Engineering Department and <a style="color: #00a4a7;" href="http://www.upmc.com/Pages/default.aspx">The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.</a></p>
<p>Entering the US Army as an Air Defense Officer, I managed Patriot Missile Platoons in Okinawa, Japan. I was lucky enough to educate hundreds of Soldiers, manage over 60 individuals and over 40 million in equipment, liaise with the Navy, Air Force and global Asian militaries, and was able to train and compete in a US Army athletic team. In the wake of the 2011 tsunami disaster in Japan I aided the effort by managing and supporting operations in the Sendai region. My life in the military not only helped me become a humble leader but also was closely akin to a sales professional and sales engineering. In short I briefed executives (High Ranking Officials) why US Patriot should be added in a defense plan and ensured that we could accommodate interaction of those technical scenarios.</p>
<p>After almost five years in the military I have moved on to attend <a style="color: #00a4a7;" href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/">The University of Maryland College Park Computer Science Master's Program</a>, where I currently conduct research under Dr. James Purtilo. I am a co-author of two papers, one of which I gave the presentation at the USENIX CSET workshop and the other of which received the best short paper award at the IEEE ESEM conference.</p>
<p>I recently worked on a team <a style="color: #00a4a7;" href="http://www.kentwills.com/cflow">information visualization</a> project, mentored by Dr. Ben Shneiderman and <a style="color: #00a4a7;" href="http://www.microstrategy.com/">MicroStrategy</a>, a business intelligence firm. Our tool, built with JavaScript and HTML5 uses CSS styling and packages Node.js and D3.js to produce a "state of the art" tool that was vetted through two usability studies and will be used as a prototype for nextGen software at MicroStrategy. While this project is front-end, the majority of my experience is developing back end technologies. I was lucky enough to take a Hadoop class with Jimmy Lin, a MIT graduate and professor at Maryland that had the opportunity to go on a two year sabbatical at Twitter. In the course we went from creating basic map reduce jobs to calculating point-wise mutual information of words, inverted indexing, and implementing the page rank algorithm. While Hadoop might seem a niche area right now, my formal education has roots in C/C++ and Java. Recently I had the opportunity to freshen my Java skills with the creation of a rudimentary mapping application that made use of QuadTries, HashTables, and B+Trees. These projects only scratch the surface and don't include my undergraduate projects in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.</p>
<p>My experience isn't just in the classroom, however, as a co-founder of a startup, I acted as the lead developer in a project where I managed two overseas developers and a designer to develop a joint Harvard, Maryland company, <a style="color: #00a4a7;" href="http://myi2.us">MyISquared</a>. For the project I developed an MVC .net application hosted on the Azure Cloud, developed the SQL database, built a data mining infrastructure, incorporated use of CDNs and built a Bayesian predictor for post sentiment on the website. While this project was engaging, we failed to acquire funding and were forced to drop the venture. </p>
<p>My background is diverse and I am not tied to a specific technology. I personally believe that, being a computer scientist, one should be able to pick up a new language and begin developing in a few weeks. I thrive in environments where infrastructure is still being created and needs to be thoroughly planned before product launch. Most of all I thrive in developing efficient processes in projects.
