Summary: MyIsquared business idea.

<a href="http://www.myIsquared.com">@MyIsquared</a> 

<p>I-Squared brings together retail investors and corporate partners, providing an online social platform that allows firms to magnify perks and convey messages directly to shareholders and potential investors. As an example, Ford (F) offers shareholders of record owning 100 shares for at least 6 months the ability to participate in X-Plan pricing. This is a pre-negotiated rate that is significantly lower than sticker prices, and just slightly above dealer invoice. However, since most individuals are unaware of this offer, they forego this $900 investment in Ford and miss the opportunity to save as much as $3,000 on the purchase of a new car. If this offer were more viral, Ford could raise additional capital for expansion and encourage continued investment with the firm, all while capturing more of the personal automobile market.

Thus, I-Squared seeks to make shareholder perks significantly more transparent to investors and potential investors. Shareholders will naturally gravitate toward brand loyalty by purchasing the consumer goods that offer the greatest benefits, which, in turn, benefits corporations. Appleâ€™s soon-to-be-released PassBook application is the preferred method of choice for streamlining the consumer redemption process.
