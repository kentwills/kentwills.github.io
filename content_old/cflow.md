Summary: Mall owners can use C-Flow to visualize foot traffic overlaid on floor plans, quickly spot profit fluctuations among stores for several time periods, and locate high impact areas in order to variably price advertisement space throughout the mall.  Even store owners can use C-Flow to make informed decisions on advertisement locations, allowing them to better reach their target audience.  Though C-Flow is still a prototype, we firmly believe that it could boost the development of business intelligence for mall and store owners.

<p> Thousands of shoppers pass through shopping malls every day. With the advent of dynamic ads in the form of electronic screens (televisions, projections, touch screens, etc.), there is an increasing demand to select consumer-relevant, time-sensitive advertisements. To meet this demand, old technologies are being used in new ways: Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) screens and cell phones are now being used to track consumer movements.</p>
<p> 
With the variety of consumer data now available, there are many new opportunities for visual analytics.  While we were not able to locate specific works for malls, more generally, there has been some research involving overlaid temporal heat maps and geospatial data points.  Our design and analysis of our tool, C-Flow, provides evidence that intelligent aggregation of this data may lead to more understandable and actionable business decisions.

<p> 
C-Flow, a proof-of-concept web application, allows mall owners and supervisors to reason about temporal consumer path data.  It combines a heat map, a geo-spatial map, and consumer flows, using modern libraries such as D3.js and Kinetic.js for responsive interaction.
