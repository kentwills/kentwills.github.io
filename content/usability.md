Summary: Increase adoption and integration of usability studies into everyday processes across all product management teams; ultimately, create a UX team and weave them into the product management development lifecycle.  Primarily this team will focus on user research and user studies.  Let’s bring the focus back to the user!

Let's Go
------
To gain support for usability research we must take a multi-angle, multi-phased approach.  It is critical to evaluate and publicize successes for each.  In order to accomplish this, success should be clearly defined qualitatively as documented thoroughly.  First we must focus on gaining internal support for usability research through three key efforts: invite one or more usability experts to give a usability talk, create a lunch-time usability discussion group, and develop a hackathon usability project. Inviting experts to talk will further provide credibility and increase interest in the lunch-time usability chat. While increasing credibility, the discussion group will aid usability efforts for those that already believe usability studies are are useful.

The lunch-time discussion groups will be a medium for documentation, education, and understanding.  By communally discussing usability studies, we will start aggregating studies and provide a corpora of knowledge about our users.  This documented knowledge will serve as a base for those that have never run a study before as well as a base for those who wish to understand what was accomplished in the past.  Furthermore, documentation will thoroughly catalog past attempts and explicitly show the benefit gained by the studies.  Through documentation and education we will be able to understand how the processes fits into the company culture and better understand how to institute a company wide program for supporting usability studies.  With documentation, education, and understanding, we can develop a rich knowledge base of our users, tested execution of studies, and thorough integration.

**Note:** *Increased application of user studies will no doubt create a culture of wanting to lst
understand our users more.  This by itself may not be enough to institute these processes internally.  We may need larger “wins” to accomplish this goal.  We must focus on publicizing successes that provide results that are contrary to current assumptions.  We will focus on showing quantitative benefits that specifically point out incorrect assumptions about user behavior.*

Finally we must combine all that we have learned into a functioning program.  A program that doesn’t execute a usability study in a vacuum, but does it in tandem with product evaluation and product creation across all verticals.
