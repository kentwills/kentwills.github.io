Summary: Web applications are a rich source of vulnerabilities due to their high exposure, diversity, and popularity. Accordingly, web application vulnerabilities are useful subjects for empirical security research. Although some information on vulnerabilities is publicly available, there are no publicly available datasets that couple vulnerabilities with their source code, metadata, and exploits through an executable test environment. We describe BugBox, a corpus and exploit simulation environment for PHP web application vulnerabilities. BugBox provides a test environment and a packaging mechanism that allows for the distribution and sharing of vulnerability data. The goal is to facilitate empirical vulnerability studies, security tool evaluation, and security metrics research. In addition, the framework promotes developer education by demonstrating exploits and providing a sandbox where they can be run safely. BugBox and its modules are opensource and available online, and new modules may be contributed by community members.
