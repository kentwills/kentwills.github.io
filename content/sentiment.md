<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Sentiment-Analysis.pdf">@Paper</a> 
<p> Recently I have been committed to a start-up that aims to bridge gaps in the ﬁnancial world. One important, recurring theme is the need for a quick assessment of aggregate analysis. One of many features that this product will provide is quick, efﬁcient, accurate analytics of RSS and Twitter feeds relating to companies. Companies will be given an overall sentiment of POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. 
</p> 
<p> My proposal is the creation of a production grade classiﬁer for this website. To elaborate, production grade should consider not only accuracy of the assessment, but also speed. Many users may not use the feature if it takes too long to load on the site, further degrading interaction. Furthermore, the dichotomy of structured and unstructured data should provide
insight as to how one may be used to support the other. This paper shows that the production grade classiﬁer is an attainable goal, although may never get used effectively due to the amount of irrelevant data.
