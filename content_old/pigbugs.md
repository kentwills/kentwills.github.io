Summary: In this paper we show how the Hadoop framework, specifically the Apache Pig platform, can be leveraged in order to gain insight on open source web applications, more specifically, the Apache Software Foundation and show further extensions to GitHub.  We explain our approach as a class-based metrics analysis that scales and be used as meta-data for predicting quality.
